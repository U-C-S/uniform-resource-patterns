# Uri Globbing

Glob patterns, but for URI/URLs.

This library is still a WIP/Experimental. Use at your own risk.

## Supported Features

- `?` One character
- `*` Zero or more characters
- `**` Recursive (globstar)
- `{a,bc,d}` List (does not support glob within the list)
- `[0-9]` Ranges (works similarly as Regex ranges)
